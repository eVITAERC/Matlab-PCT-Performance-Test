# Matlab Parallel Computing Toolbox benchmark suite for SLIM

This package provides a set of standalone benchmarks for high-performance computing clusters using the Matlab [Parallel Computing Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing/) programming paradigm built on top of MPI. Most of the benchmark routines make use of the `spmd` and `co/distributed array` paradigm instead of directly making MPI calls.

The benchmarks are partitioned into different directories according to their purpose:

- `HPCchallenge`: includes a modified set of [HPCC benchmarks](http://www.hpcchallenge.org/) implemented by Mathworks and included as demos in the Matlab PCT distribution
